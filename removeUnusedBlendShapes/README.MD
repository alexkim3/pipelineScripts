**Script category:** *Rigging*

For the models generated from Character Creator software there are many usable blend shapes and not all of them are used for the final character rig. Generating rigged models with unused blend shapes can become heavy in file size, therefore the tool for removing unused (unconnected) blendshapes was created for the studio pipeline.

## Guides
Run the script without any object selection (the code handles all blend shapes in the whole scene)
